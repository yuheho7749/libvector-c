# Vectorized Vector Library (for C)

Vectorized vector library (aka vectorized dynamic array library) that exposes "low-level" data types (raw bytes) while not being too hard to use.

*NOTE: eXetended vector operation not implemented yet*

## Starter Description
This library has two header files `vector.h` and `xvector.h`.
- `vector.h`: basic vector (dynamic array) functions.
- `xvector.h`: eXtended vector operations (planned, but not implemented yet), in addition to basic `vector.h` functions.
