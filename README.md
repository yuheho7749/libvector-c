# C Vector Lib (for fun)
It sucks, but I just wrote it for fun I guess?

Basically, this vector implementation (without type unions, etc) guarantees that elems are tightly packed. Also, if you know what you are doing, then you can also manipulate multiple elements (aka raw bulk accesses)

## Maybe TODO?
- [ ] SIMD vectorization (SSE, AVX2/512)
